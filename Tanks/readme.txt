Unity Tutorial 2 readme file

I completed the tutorial, build it correctly, and saved it as an executable named "Main_Tanks."

For my "something unique" I added a random number between 10 and 20 green spheres to the field every round. If the tank were to run over the sphere, it will "recharge" or gain all of its life back. Once a tank rolls over a sphere, it will be destroyed. At the end of each round, the unused spheres are destroyed and new ones are created.
